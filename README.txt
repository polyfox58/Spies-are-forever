I don't really know what goes here, but I'm going to put run information

To run the project you should just have to unzip the folder and run the solution. You may need to have monogame as an extention. If you don't the instruction link is below

https://monogame.net/articles/getting_started/1_setting_up_your_development_environment_windows.html

Also the folder is called Spies Are Forever but the project is just called NEA so sorry if that causes any confusion
